We will cover some IDEs here, that may be useful if you edit locally
with the :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker`.

When editing reST files locally, you should use an editor or IDE with
good support for syntax highlighting and marking errors in reST.

*  `PhpStorm <https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/>`__ is commonly used by
   developers in the TYPO3 community. It does however cost money. PhpStorm
   comes with a number of plugins for TYPO3, for example for TypoScript and Fluid.
*  **Visual Studio Code** also comes with plugins for TYPO3 and for reStructuredText.
   And it is free.

Other alternatives can be found in the "Free Editors" section of
`StackOverflow: reStructuredText tool support <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2747041/2444812>`__.

The editor or IDE should ideally have the following features:

*  syntax highlighting for reST
*  show syntax errors
*  provide possibility to use (configurable) code snippets for easy insertion of
   directives
*  provide keyboard shortcuts and configurable commands for running
   Docker
*  built in spell checking (English)

Setup your editor / IDE to use the .editorconfig file, which already
exists in most documentation repositories. This will set up your
editor / IDE to comply with our :ref:`basic coding guidelines
<format-rest-cgl>`.

You may have to install
an additional plugin, see `EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org/#download>`__.

The LeXtudio extension comes with some built in code snippets.

You can easily extend the snippets by adding **user snippets**:

#. Open :guilabel:`File > Preferences > User Snippets`
#. Enter a name
#. Edit the json file

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "image (full)": {
         "prefix": "imgf",
         "body": [
            ".. image:: $1",
            "   :class: with-shadow",
            "   :alt: $2",
            "   :target: $3",
            "$4"
         ],
         "description": "image with parameters"
      }
   }

*  You can enter the snippet by typing `imgf`:code: and then TAB
*  The $1, $2 etc. mark the places where further TABs will take you.
   Use this if extra text needs to be entered

Additionally, (download) and enable the `EditorConfig <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig>`__
plugin in order to get correct Coding Guideline settings like indent width already defined in
.editorconfig file of documentation project.

Spellchecking
-------------

You can add some specific TYPO3 spellings to PhpStorms internal dictionary.
Just place the cursor on the word, click alt-enter and then "Save to dictionary".
