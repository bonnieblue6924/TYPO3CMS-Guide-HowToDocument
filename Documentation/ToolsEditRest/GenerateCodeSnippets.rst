Automatic Code Snippets
=======================

Most official manuals and some third-party extension manuals feature
automatic code-snipped generation from source.

You can detect an automatically generated file by the following comment on top:

..  code-block:: rst
    :caption: SomeCodeSnippet.rst.txt

    .. Generated by https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3docs-codesnippets
    .. Extracted from EXT:examples/Configuration/TypoScript/DataProcessors/General.typoscript

Each manual that supports automatic code snippet generation must have a file
:file:`Documentation\codesnippets.php` which configures the code-snippets to be
generated. It must also require all packages that are referenced or needed for
code-generation in its :file:`composer.json` in the `require-dev` section.

We ship the official manuals with a ready to use DDEV configuration and
composer scripts that generate the code-snippets. Therefore the following steps
can be used to generate the code-snippets:

#.  Clone the repository from GitHub.
#.  Start the project in DDEV: :bash:`ddev start`
#.  Install via composer: :bash:`ddev composer install`
#.  Generate the code snippets: :bash:`ddev composer generate:codesnippets`
#.  Compare and commit the changed files
